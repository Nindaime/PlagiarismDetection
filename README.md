# PlagiarismDetection
 A plagiarism detection system that uses the “Running Karp-Rabin” String Matching Algorithm to detect plagiarism between documents uploaded or stored on the system. Comparison is performed on every combination of pairing; the plagiarized sections are visualized as outputs. Software is developed using JavaFX and Fork and Join Java API for parallelism.
